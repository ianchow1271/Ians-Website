          <p class="experience-time">August 2023 - Present</p>
          <p class="experience-description">I coordinated technical issue resolutions across teams using Service Now
            (SNow) and managed an extensive PC and laptop disk image library for efficient system deployments. I
            directly supported clients with hardware and software concerns and played a vital role in facilitating
            virtual meetings for LA city council members.</p>

          <p class="experience-time"> June 2023 - Present</p>
          <p class="experience-description">I collaborated with a team of three to create a web version of the "Hit or
            Miss" board game, developing a JVM web server in Kotlin with http4k and React frontend assets. I implemented
            bug fixes, improved design, and provided comprehensive documentation. Additionally, I handled backend logic
            for game mechanics and user interactions, ensuring seamless integration.</p>

          <h3 class="experience-title">CALSys Lab, CA</h3>
          <p class="experience-time"> April - August 2023</p>
          <p class="experience-description">My research centers on designing and constructing a cyberinfrastructure
            dedicated to extracting malicious hacker data from the dark web for the creation of cyber-threat
            intelligence models. This project involved debugging and refactoring legacy code responsible for scraping
            and parsing malicious hacking data. Furthermore, I conducted extensive research and implemented solutions to
            address the challenges associated with collecting data from the darknet.</p>

          <h3 class="experience-title">Cal Poly Pomona STEAM Academy, CA</h3>
          <p class="experience-time">June - August 2021</p>
          <p class="experience-description">I honed my programming skills in Python through the MIT Beaver Works
            curriculum. Notably, I successfully implemented an autonomous RACECAR program, showcasing my proficiency in
            navigating complex environments. Throughout this experience, I collaborated closely with fellow interns and
            CPP alumni, further enhancing my problem-solving abilities.</p>

          <h3 class="experience-title">Chapman University Internship, CA </h3>
          <p class="experience-time"> March - August 2021</p>
          <p class="experience-description">I had the valuable opportunity to shadow Dr. Yuxin Wen, whose research
            centers on data science and Big Data analytics in complex systems. During this experience, I deepened my
            proficiency in Python and was assigned the task of learning how to detect defects in wafer maps during
            manufacturing operations. To tackle this challenge, I took the initiative to organize and lead a team of two
            students, utilizing Anaconda Python for our research on wafer maps analysis.</p>

          <h3 class="experience-title">Seven Logics, CA</h3>
          <p class="experience-time"> June â€“ November 2020</p>
          <p class="experience-description">During my shadowing experience with a software engineer, I focused on
            studying Java concepts. As part of a project, I was assigned the task of analyzing data for A/B testing of
            an upcoming mobile application to discern user preferences. This involved extensive research on information
            and conversion rates to identify which version performed optimally.</p>
